Generates an XML sitemap for cache plugins.

== Description ==

This plugin creates an XML sitemap with all posts, pages, categories, archives and tag pages, regardless of whether they are excluded from search engine indexing or not.

The advantage over a normal sitemap is that no pages are excluded from the sitemap. You can specify the XML cache sitemap in your cache plugin, such as [LiteSpeed Cache](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/litespeed-cache/), to fully warm up your website cache.

== Screenshots ==

1. XML Cache Menu & Settings.
2. Enable or disable XML cache for a specific post or page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the URL to the sitemap? =

The sitemap can be accessed at /cache.xml. You can also simply click on the "Open Sitemap" button in the settings to open the sitemap and copy the URL from the browser address bar.

= How can I exclude posts and pages from the sitemap? =

Open the post or page you want to exclude. You will find the option to disable the XML cache on the right.
